###  Purpose

**SpatialEpiApp** is a **Shiny** web application that allows to visualize spatial and spatio-temporal disease data, estimate disease risk and detect clusters.

The application allows to fit Bayesian disease models to obtain risk estimates and their uncertainty by using **R-INLA**, and to detect clusters by using the scan statistics implemented in **SaTScan**.

The application allows user interaction and creates interactive visualizations such as maps supporting padding and zooming and tables that allow for filtering. It also enables the generation of reports containing the analyses performed.


###  Structure

The application consists of three pages: 

- 'Inputs' where the user can upload the
input files and select the type of analysis
- 'Analysis' where statistical analyses
are carried out, results can be visualized, and reports can be generated
- 'Help'
containing information about the application use and references.


**Inputs page**

The 'Inputs' page is the first page we see when we launch the application. In this page we can upload the required files and select the type of analysis to be performed. It is composed of four components: 
- Upload map
- Upload data
- Select analysis
- Contents

**Start analysis button**

When we click the 'Start analysis' button the application checks the files and options entered are correct and calculates the expected counts for each area and date. It also computes the ratio of the observed divided the expected. This ratio is called SIR irrespectively if data refers to mortality or incidence. Then the application redirects to the 'Analysis' page.

**Analysis page**


In the 'Analysis' page we can visualize the data, perform the statistical analyses, and generate
reports. On the top of the page there are four buttons:

- 'Edit Inputs' button is used when we wish to return to the 'Inputs' page to modify the analysis options or upload new data.

- 'Maps Pop O E SIR' button creates plots of the population, observed, expected and SIR variables.

- 'Estimate risk' button is used for estimating
the disease risk and their uncertainty

- 'Detect clusters' is used for the detection of disease clusters

The 'Analysis' page also contains four tabs called 'Interactive', 'Maps', 'Clusters' and 'Report' that include tables and plots with the results.

**Help page**

Both the 'Inputs' and the 'Analysis' pages include a 'Help' button that redirects to the
'Help' page. This page shows information about the use of the application, the statistiscal
methodology and the developing tools employed.
